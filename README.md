Lists of Youtube channel IDs that are known or suspected of being AI-Slop and/or low-effort content. These lists can be used with browser extensions like Blocktube to hide the offending channels from searches and suggestions. Channels included in the lists have, to varying degrees of scrutiny, been indivudally reviewed and subjectively assessed as being slop. Current lists and number of channels included are organized by topic below:

* [**Military history and stories**](Military.txt) - 810+
* [**Warhammer**](Warhammer.txt) - 70+
* [**Reviews**](Reviews.txt) - 5
* [**Geopolitics**](Geopolitics.txt) - 5

New slop channels are created daily and these lists are expected to become outdated rather quickly, less being updated routinely, or Youtube makes structural changes that makes producing slop content prohibitive. It's possible non-slop channels may be listed due to error. Effort is taken, for example, to stop channels that are human researched, written and edited, but narrated with AI due to language barriers, from being added to these lists.

Judgment as being slop is subjective. The following criteria are considered:

* Heavy usage of clearly AI generated writing, images, video and voice narration.
* Nonsensical video editing. (e.g. showing stock footage of modern airliners while discussing the 1950s airline industry)
* High levels of content output. (e.g. 2+ hour videos uploaded daily or multiple times a day)
* Highly repetitive, formulaic content. (e.g. every 2nd video follows "X couldn't believe it when Y happened!")
* Declaration that the channel/content is AI generated.
* Absence of credible biographic information of the content creator. (e.g. someone produces 2+ hours of content daily but is only known as WW2Stories7)
* Limited or no channel content prior to widespread adoption of AI generation on Youtube. (c.a. Q4 2024 or Q1 2025)
* Bizzare channel pivots. (e.g. channel name and early videos were about arts and crafts but now every video is about WW2 battleships)
* Identical or extremely similar content to other channels, all uploadeded in a narrow window of time ([Example 1](images/slop1.png), [Example 2](images/slop2.png), [Example 3](images/slop3.png))
* Obvious factual errors in content, simple spelling errors, etc.

Some categories, such as geopolitics, suffer from low effort more than slop AI content. For example, taking the recording of a university lecture and replacing the original video, which may have contained maps and graphs, with completely unrelated stock footage while not attributing where or when the lecture originally took place.

Channels may represent edge cases or challenge categorization. These are currently not included, though they are very rare. In the first 150 military related channels included in the list, there were only 2-3 channels that were debatable and subsequently not included. Examples include hour long videos of historic footage.

I will be adding more lists in the future and others are welcome to contribute.

This list does not include channels that only make Youtube Shorts as I currently use an extension that hides all Youtube shorts. I may expand the list to include those channels in the future.
