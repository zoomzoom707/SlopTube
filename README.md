Lists of Youtube channel IDs that are known or suspected of being AI-Slop and/or low-effort content, which can be used with browser extensions like Blocktube to hide them while browsing Youtube. The lists are created by subjective, individual, manual review and are organized by topic (i.e. military history, science-fiction, etc.).

These lists will likely become incomplete as new slop channels are created daily and it's possible non-slop channels may be listed due to error.

Judgment as being slop is subjective but depends, to varying degree, on the following factors:
* Heavy usage of AI generated images or videos.
* Use of AI Voice generation for narration.
* High levels of content output (e.g. 2+ hour videos uploaded every day or multiple times a day)
* Highly repetitive, formulaic content (e.g. every 2nd video follows "X couldn't believe it when Y happened!")
* Declaration that the content is AI generated
* Absence of credible biographic information of the content creator. (e.g. someone produces 2 hours of content daily but is only known as WW2Stories7)
